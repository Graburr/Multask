# Multask
This is my first project using python making a bot for a discord channel with the api of discord. 
Any suggestion for improving the code are welcome.

I used it to learn more about Coroutines, Threading, making http/s request with their API, etc. If you don't show documentation of how to set it up, it's because I was bussy with the test of University. I will documentate how to set it up when I have free time and feel like it. However you can see de documentation of the code, I documented it using the Numpy standard.
